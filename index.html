                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name Ochuko Egesi, ALT ID <strong>ALT/SOE/024/0546</strong>. 
                I am a graduate of the Afe Babalola University, where I studied Biochemistry.
                I am from Delta State, Urhobo by tribe. 
                I started in the world of nursing driven by passion to care for people and make a difference in their lives but as I worked my way through the healthcare system, I realised there was so much more I wanted to do.
                I began to see how technology could be a game changer in healthcare and that's when I started exploring the world of technology and eventually found myself drawn to cloud engineering. 
                I could see  the potential for cloud technology to revolutionalise not just healthcare but other industries.
                I am currently enrolled as a student at AltSchool Africa Engineering Karatu 2024, Cloud Engineering track.
                My goal in this program is to learn everything I can about cloud infrastructure and services, and how to use them to build efficient, secure, and scalable systems.</p>
